# Migration from Pages Router to App Router

## Migration Date
September 28, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. App Router Structure Created
- ✅ Created `app/` directory with proper structure
- ✅ Added `app/layout.js` for root layout
- ✅ Added `app/page.js` for homepage
- ✅ Added `app/globals.css` with CSS custom properties
- ✅ Added `app/loading.js` for loading states
- ✅ Added `app/not-found.js` for 404 errors

### 2. Pages Converted
- ✅ Homepage: `pages/index.js` → `app/page.js`
- ✅ About: `pages/about.js` → `app/about/page.js`
- ✅ Article: `pages/article.js` → `app/article/page.js`
- ✅ 404 Page: `pages/404.js` → `app/not-found.js`

### 3. API Routes Converted
- ✅ Newsletter API: `pages/api/newsletter.js` → `app/api/newsletter/route.js`

### 4. Components Updated
- ✅ Header component updated with 'use client' directive
- ✅ Added proper semantic HTML and CSS custom properties
- ✅ Improved mobile menu with data-testid for testing

### 5. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Updated `next.config.js` for App Router support
- ✅ Updated `tailwind.config.js` to include app directory
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with testing scripts from local.md
- ✅ Updated color scheme to match design system

### 6. Best Practices Implemented
From local.md recommendations:
- ✅ CSS Custom Properties for consistent spacing
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure (header, main, footer)
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ Consistent CSS class naming conventions
- ✅ App Router SEO optimization with metadata
- ✅ Loading states and error boundaries
- ✅ Proper TypeScript/JavaScript extensions support

### 7. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Added Playwright configuration
- ✅ Added test scripts to package.json
- ✅ Created basic homepage test
- ✅ Added data-testid attributes for testing

### 8. Files Backed Up
- ✅ Complete `pages/` directory backed up to `pages-backup/`
- ✅ Old `styles/globals.css` preserved

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Migrate remaining API routes
- [ ] Convert remaining pages (contact, mission, admin, etc.)
- [ ] Update any hardcoded page routes in components
- [ ] Run comprehensive tests
- [ ] Deploy and verify

## Notes
- Both Pages Router and App Router can coexist during transition
- Old pages are backed up in `pages-backup/` directory
- App Router takes precedence for routes that exist in both
- CSS custom properties added for consistent design system
- SEO improvements with proper metadata API

## Testing Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run test         # Run Playwright tests
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run deploy       # Deploy to Vercel
```

## Key Benefits Achieved
1. **Performance**: Server Components by default
2. **SEO**: Better metadata handling
3. **Developer Experience**: Better file-based routing
4. **Loading States**: Improved UX with loading.js
5. **Error Handling**: Better error boundaries
6. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript integration
7. **Testing**: Improved test infrastructure
