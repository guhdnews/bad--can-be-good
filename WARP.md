# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

"News Can Be Good" is a Next.js web application that aggregates and displays positive news from RSS feeds. The project aims to counteract negative news consumption by curating uplifting content from reliable sources.

## Development Commands

### Core Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server on localhost:3000
npm run build      # Build production version
npm start          # Start production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
```

### Testing Individual Components
- Test news fetching: Visit `/api/fetch-news` endpoint directly
- Test single pages: Navigate to `/quiz`, `/donate`, or `/` in browser
- Debug RSS feeds: Check browser console when clicking "Refresh Latest News"

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow Architecture
The application follows a hub-and-spoke pattern centered around RSS feed aggregation:

1. **RSS Aggregation Pipeline** (`lib/newsUtils.js`, `lib/rssFetcher.js`)
   - Fetches from curated positive news RSS feeds
   - Filters content using positive keyword matching
   - Stores articles in MongoDB with deduplication

2. **API Layer** (`pages/api/`)
   - `fetch-news.js`: Main news aggregation endpoint with timeout handling
   - `subscribe.js`: Email subscription management
   - `send-newsletter.js`: Newsletter distribution system

3. **Database Layer** (`lib/mongodb.js`)
   - MongoDB connection with server-side only access
   - Articles collection with automatic deduplication by title
   - User preferences storage for personalization

### Frontend Architecture
- **Page-based routing** using Next.js Pages Router
- **Server-side rendering** for SEO optimization and initial data loading
- **Component-based UI** with shared Header/Footer components
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom theme colors (`nur-blue`, `nur-light`)

### Key Technical Patterns

#### RSS Feed Management
The application uses a resilient RSS parsing strategy:
- Limited feed sources (2 primary feeds) to prevent timeouts
- `Promise.allSettled()` for graceful feed failure handling  
- Positive keyword filtering with predefined criteria
- 3-second timeout per feed with fallback mechanisms

#### Database Patterns
- Connection reuse with global `clientPromise`
- Server-side only database access (client-side protection)
- Upsert operations for article deduplication
- Date-based sorting for chronological display

#### Email Integration
- Newsletter system using Nodemailer
- Subscription management with email validation
- Automated positive news digest generation

## Environment Variables

Required `.env` variables:
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `EMAIL_USER`: SMTP email account for newsletter
- `EMAIL_PASS`: Email account app password
- `PRINTFUL_API_TOKEN`: Merchandise integration token
- `MERCH_LINK`: Printful store URL

## Key Files and Their Purpose

### Core Business Logic
- `lib/newsUtils.js`: RSS parsing, filtering, and database operations
- `pages/api/fetch-news.js`: Optimized news fetching endpoint with error handling
- `pages/index.js`: Main homepage with SSR article loading

### Data Processing
- `lib/mongodb.js`: Database connection and server-side access control
- `pages/api/subscribe.js`: User subscription management
- `pages/api/send-newsletter.js`: Automated newsletter distribution

### User Interface  
- `components/Header.js`: Navigation with donation integration
- `pages/quiz.js`: User preference collection for personalization
- `pages/donate.js`: PayPal donation integration

## Development Considerations

### RSS Feed Reliability
The system prioritizes speed and reliability:
- Only 2-3 most reliable RSS sources to prevent timeouts
- Aggressive timeout settings (3 seconds per feed)
- Fallback mechanisms for failed feeds
- Articles limited to 3 per feed to maintain performance

### Database Performance
- Articles are deduplicated by title before insertion
- MongoDB ObjectId converted to strings for JSON serialization
- Server-side rendering pre-loads articles for better UX

### Content Filtering
Positive news identification uses keyword matching on:
- Article titles and descriptions
- Predefined positive keywords array
- Manual curation of RSS feed sources

### Styling Architecture
Uses Tailwind CSS with:
- Custom color palette for brand consistency
- Responsive design patterns
- Component-based styling approach
- Custom utilities for "nur-blue" and "nur-light" theme colors
